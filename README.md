# ROAR-22
My "Social Media"-application redone with modern MERN-stack with React Hooks and Context API.

The application was based off my Helsinki Business College React-Redux-Firebase-Firestore app: https://github.com/otsolap/Roar-Social-Network-React-Redux-Firebase-Firestore.

This was done by following the videocourse from Lama Dev: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOxWrX5MIdXIeRNaXC3sqIg

The goal of this project was to practise MERN-stack better to use these skills on my fitness application: https://github.com/otsolap/bare-necessities
